# Fake-Currency-Detection
Fake Currency Detection is a task of binary classification in machine learning. If we have enough data on real and fake banknotes, we can use that data to train a model that can classify the new banknotes as real or fake.

The target value is simply 0 for real banknotes and 1 for fake banknotes.

The dataset contains these four input characteristics:(Variance, Assymetry, Kurtosis,  Entropy.)

Data exploration with pair plot.
